# Lagrange Interpolation

A Java implementation of the **Lagrange Interpolation** method used to approximate the value of a function based on a discrete set of known points. The program calculates the interpolating polynomial using the Lagrange formula and evaluates the result at a user-specified value.

## Features
- Calculates interpolated values using the Lagrange interpolation technique.
- Supports any number of input points.
- Provides intermediate calculation steps to enhance understanding.

## About
This project was created as part of my academic work to practice implementing numerical algorithms. The goal was to apply the Lagrange interpolation method to solve real-world approximation problems based on discrete data points.
